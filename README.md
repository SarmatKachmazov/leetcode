## 🚀 About the Project

This repository documents my personal journey through **LeetCode** — solving algorithmic and data-related challenges across various domains and programming languages.  
Every solution focuses on:
- 🧠 **Clarity** — clean, readable code with meaningful structure.  
- ⚙️ **Depth** — multiple approaches where possible (brute-force → optimized).  
- 📊 **Analysis** — time and space complexity for each solution.  
- 💬 **Reflection** — understanding *why* an approach works, not just *how*.

## 🌟 Goals

- Build strong algorithmic intuition.  
- Master cross-language problem solving.  
- Document every key insight along the way.  
- Create a foundation for interviews, real-world data engineering, and system design.
